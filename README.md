# NFL-Data

Data extracted from Fantasy.NFL.com divided by season and player position,
along with weekly numbers and projections. 

The extract goes back to the 2015 season as that is the first available season
with a full dataset for all positions. 

Point total and player ranks are specific for the MML league point system but 
all outer data are raw and can be used for other calculations and simulations. 

All data are available in comma-separated CSV files or row-divided JSON.
